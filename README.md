Hi, I’m Isha 👋  

I build AI systems that turn research ideas into reliable, real-world products.

🧠 Current interests  
- Large Language Models (LLMs) & Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)  
- Agentic AI and applied reinforcement learning  
- Multimodal learning (text · audio · vision)  
- Human-centered and trustworthy AI systems

## 🚀 Selected Work

🔹 **Legal Eagle**  
LLM-powered contract analysis and drafting using RAG.  
Focus: clause extraction, risk identification, and explainability over hallucination.

🔹 **AcademIQ**  
AI-driven education platform for lesson planning and course creation.  
Focus: credibility of generated content, personalization, and human trust.

🔹 **EmotiSense**  
Multimodal emotion recognition using CNNs and LSTMs.  
Focus: real-time inference and assistive technology applications.
